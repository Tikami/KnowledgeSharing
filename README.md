# Share Yourself

Knowledge Sharing System is a simple system engine to store and share your collected artilces or other stuff on your local server

the query part is powerful, and you can organize your query string like

`tags: =program, @rails, -route | type: video | rails routes`

>> '|' is a bit like linux pipe command


it's build on 
rails 
angularjs
underscore
bootstrap
...

you can treat it as a demo for rails + angularjs
